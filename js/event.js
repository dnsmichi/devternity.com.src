Some developers do not consider their unit tests to be proper code, because unit tests are not shipped with the software. On the other hand, many developers do not consider configuration to be code, even though it is shipped with the software, defines how the software executes and is written in a formal notation. And imagine deploying a system with millions and millions of configuration parameters that none of the developers understood or knew how to test properly? Imagine machine learning. This talk is a journey into code, a journey into testing, a journey into quality and a journey into keeping software soft. There's no need to make it harder than it already is.",

Once we move away from a single process to many services and processes, we immediately hit the problem that our services need to communicate with each other. The architect mandated REST! But then nothing worked in production. Then came events! And nothing ever completed. In this talk we'll look at the problem from a holistic perspective - take the fundamental property of autonomy for any microservice-based architecture, and design how services should communicate so that they can still achieve their purpose in the world. We'll cover basic communication patterns, where we run into problems with them, and how advanced conversational patterns can help. Finally, we'll look at some real-world scenarios for designing complex coordination and where conversation patterns can retain our autonomy and loose coupling.",

            "description": "Statically typed functional programming languages encourage a very different way of thinking about types. The type system is your friend, not an annoyance, and can be used in many ways that might not be familiar to OO programmers. Types can be used to represent the domain in a fine-grained, self documenting way. And in many cases, types can even be used to encode business rules so that you literally cannot create incorrect code. You can then use the static type checking almost as an instant unit test — making sure that your code is correct at compile time. In this talk, we'll look at some of the ways you can use types as part of a domain driven design process, with some simple real world examples in F#.

            "description": "Twenty years ago Google was struggling to search the vast amount of data in the web, while Amazon was struggling to move an increasing volume of transactions through its monolithic architecture. Their solutions broke new ground in software engineering even as they enabled the companies to thrive. Creative approaches to digital technology have been fundamental in enabling the massive scale and incredible speed of today’s digital giants. More than that, they are at the core of every successful digital transformation. This talk will discuss how software engineering has been changed by the scale and speed required of digital companies in the past, now, and in the future.",

            "description": "Many programmers get stuck when they try to learn evolutionary design, particularly the refactoring part of it. It never seems to get easier, it never seems to go faster, and so it always seems safer to rip things apart and write them again. If you or someone you know feels stuck like this, then let's talk about why that happens and what to do about it. I'm pretty sure that will also provide a nice starting point for larger discussions about our work as programmers, how evolutionary design (TDD, refactoring) fits in, and anything else that we feel vaguely interested in talking about. My brain will be open.",

            "description": "Microservices have been a popular architecture choice for at least 5 years by now. Over these years we've adopted microservices architectures to ever growing set of use-cases and different development and deployment strategies. Lessons were learned and our ability to design, develop, deploy and operate microservices has improved. This presentation will give an opinionated view of how microservices evolved in the last few years, based on experience gained while working with companies using Apache Kafka to update their application architecture. We'll discuss the rise of API gateways, service mesh, state management and serverless architectures - what works well, and in which cases. We'll show real-world examples of how applications become more resilient and scalable when new patterns are introduced, and make sure to include caveats - because patterns are all about using them in the right context.",
