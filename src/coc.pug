                    |  is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment for participants of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, and beliefs. We’ve written this code of conduct not because we expect bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is one necessary part of building a respectful community space.
                h3 DevTernity participants and organizers agree to:
                p 
                    b TLDR: Be nice and respect people.                
                p Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, harassing actions and hate speech. Examples of such actions include, but are not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, 
                    b  please alert any member of the conference team in Slack (the ones with 'crew' in their names).
                p Take care of each other. Alert a member of the conference team if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the conference. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the conference team with a concise description of your grievance; any grievances filed will be considered by the entire DevTernity team.)
                p We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of DevTernity conference, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
